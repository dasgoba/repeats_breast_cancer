# repeats_breast_cancer
Short tandem repeats/perfect microsatellites have been mined from Breast cancer cell line and two high quality human reference genomes using PERF and compared abundances (both in no. and length) in different genomic locations. Genomic locations of the repeats mined from the sequencing reads have been found using alignment method.
