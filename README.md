# repeats_breast_cancer
Short tandem repeats/perfect microsatellites have been mined from a metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDAMB453_BREAST) and two high quality human reference genomes (GRCh38.p14 and T2T-CHM13.v2.0) using PERF and compared abundances (both in no. and length) in different genomic locations. Genomic locations of the repeats mined from the sequencing reads have been determined using alignment method.
